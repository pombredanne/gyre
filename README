1. Installation

You will need:
	* a working webserver (Apache works for me...)
	* a working python system, version 2.3 or better, with
	  the default set of libraries, including cgi.py and rfc822.py
	  among others

2. Configuration

This section will go through the variables and files involved in
configuring Gyre.

3. Writing articles

4. Contributing changes back

If you modify this program so it does something funky, new, and/or
exciting, I'd really like to hear about it. If I ever release another
version, your new feature could well become part of it :-)

You can contact me at the email address given at the top of this
message. I hope you enjoy this program.
